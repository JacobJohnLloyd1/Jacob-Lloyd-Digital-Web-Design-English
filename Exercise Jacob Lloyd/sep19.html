    <h1>The Life of Maradona</h1>

    <p class = "right_column">diego Maradona was an argentine football legend,
        renowned as one of the greatest players of all time,
        who led Argentina to victory in the 1986 World Cup and won championships with
        clubs like Napoli. His extraordinary ball control and playmaking abilities
        were matched by a controversial career marked by cocaine addiction and
        a 1994 doping ban. He is remembered for his iconic "Hand of God" goal
        and his charismatic, albeit tumultuous, life, which ended in 2020
        with a cardiac arrest. </p>
